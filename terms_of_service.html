### Governing Law

These Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **India**, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. 

Subject to the arbitration provisions below, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in India for matters not subject to arbitration (including enforcement of arbitration awards and injunctive relief).

### Dispute Resolution Process

We believe most concerns can be resolved quickly and amicably. If you have any dispute with us, you agree to the following resolution process:

1. **Informal Resolution (Required First Step):**  
   Before filing any formal claim, you must contact us at [dhruv.bansal62903@gmail.com](mailto:dhruv.bansal62903@gmail.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Provide a detailed description of the dispute and your desired resolution. We will work with you in good faith to resolve the issue within 30 days.

2. **Mediation:**  
   If informal resolution fails, both parties agree to attempt mediation before pursuing arbitration or litigation. The mediation shall take place in India and be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon mediator.

3. **Arbitration:**  
   If mediation fails, any remaining disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 of India. The arbitration shall be conducted in English and take place in India.

4. **Class Action Waiver:**  
   You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

### Exceptions

Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights.
